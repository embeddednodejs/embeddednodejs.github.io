# Chapter 13: Wireless Data with Bluetooth

The [Bluetooth Spec](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/bluetooth-core-specification) offers a wireless link between devices. Devices can act either as central (similar to a server) or peripheral (similar to a client). There is [a list of BLE profiles](https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServicesHome.aspx).

Some important libraries for JavaScript are:

# ble-shepher

The [ble-shepherd](https://github.com/bluetoother/ble-shepherd) is an open-source BLE network gateway solution for full-stack web developers to integrate their BLE machines and webapps. An example for a BLE driver is [cc-bnp: TI CC254X SoC driver](https://github.com/bluetoother/cc-bnp).

# BIPSO

And [BIPSO](http://bluetoother.github.io/bipso) is an open spec that defines a set of BLE characteristics to follow the IPSO Smart Object Guideline for developers building their applications with a unified data model.

# PunchThrough LightBean

The PunchThrough boards support calling sketches from the command line with a Node.js tool. 
You can install this tool with:

    $ npm install -g bean-sdk

Then, you can follow the examples from the [guides](https://punchthrough.com/bean/docs/guides/getting-started/cli-loader/)
