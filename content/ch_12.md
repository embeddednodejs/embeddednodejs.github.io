# Chapter 12: Making robots with JavaScript

With origins in a web browser,  JavaScript has many examples of programming language for interactive experiences. As such, JavaScript is also a good language to build robots to interact with.

## General robotics

Before starting with programming, try to get a feeling for the bigger picture around robots. For example, there [Rodney Brooks: Why we will rely on robots?](https://www.ted.com/talks/rodney_brooks_why_we_will_rely_on_robots?language=en).  For kids, there is the [Mirobot project - drawing for children](http://mirobot.io/).

For the book most important however are [Nodebots](http://nodebots.io/). You can read some motivations in [this blog post on the rise of JavaScript robotics](http://www.voodootikigod.com/nodebots-the-rise-of-js-robotics/).

## Robot kits

To get started with robots with JavaScript you also need some hardware. One example is the [Veter robot](http://veterobot.com/) which you can build yourself with these [instructions](http://veterobot.com/buildyourself.html). Another example is the [Sumobot](https://github.com/makenai/sumobot-jr).

## Sensors

For robots it is generally useful to learn about inputs and outputs for motion. One example is the

## Connectivity

## Cats and Robots

How to connect a cat with the internet? [Tomomi](https://twitter.com/girlie_mac) showss a number of approaches in her [talk at JSKongress](http://www.slideshare.net/tomomi/js-kongress-2016-kittycamjs-raspberry-pi-camera-w-cat-facial-detection) . More ideas can be found on her [blog](http://www.girliemac.com/).
