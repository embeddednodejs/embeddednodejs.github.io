# Chapter 11: Entering the Cloud

This chapter shows how to move bytes and messages across networks. As a start the publish-subscribe pattern is reviewed where devices require a direct link to talk to each other.

Then a message broker is used to remove the need for a sttic link between devices.

## Publish-Subscribe Pattern

* [PubSub pattern with DNode](http://substack.net/roll_your_own_pubsub_with_dnode)
* [EventEmitter API docs](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_emit_event_arg1_arg2)



## MQTT

A good place to learn about [MQTT](http://mqtt.org) is the [MQTT Protocol specification v3.1](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/webservices/ws-mqtt/mqtt-v3r1.html).

MQTT messages have a 2 byte header which is much shorter than for examples headers in HTTP.  MQTT messages can have different types as indicated by the 4 Message Type bits.

<!--
<table>
<thead><tr><th>bit</th>
<th>7</th>
<th>6</th>
<th>5</th>
<th>4</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>1</th>
<th>0</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>byte 1</td>
<td>Message Type</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>


</tr>
<tr><td>byte 2</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
-->

To work with  [mqtt.js in Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt), the mqtt package is a good start.  A nice Node.js broker is [Mosca](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mosca).

Some tools can help you debugging and exploring MQTT messages such as:
* [Mosquitto library](http://mosquitto.org/)
* [HiveMQ Broker](http://www.hivemq.com/try-out/)


## Cloud services

* [PubNub](https://github.com/pubnub/javascript)
* [PubSub with the Telegram Bot API](https://medium.com/@rssilva/talking-with-arduino-using-telegram-and-javascript-d874a0b560cb#.d7b2cg97q)
