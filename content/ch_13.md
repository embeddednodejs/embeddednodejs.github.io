# Chapter 13: Wireless Data with Bluetooth

The [Bluetooth Spec](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/bluetooth-core-specification) offers a wireless link between devices.

A device can either act as a central (similar to a server) or peripheral (similar to a client). 

A peripheral operates in a certain context or "profile". There is [a list of BLE profiles](https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServicesHome.aspx).

# Bleno and Noble

Some popular libraries to get started with JavaScript and Bluetooth are:

* The [Noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble) can scan for peripherals and and communicate with them.
* The [Bleno](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/bleno) library can emulate Bluetooth profiles of a device. 

# Beacons

A special kind of Bluetooth peripherals are Beacons. Beacons can contain bits of informations.

# ble-shepherd

The [ble-shepherd](https://github.com/bluetoother/ble-shepherd) is an open-source BLE network gateway solution for full-stack web developers to integrate their BLE machines and webapps. An example for a BLE driver is [cc-bnp: TI CC254X SoC driver](https://github.com/bluetoother/cc-bnp).

# BIPSO

[BIPSO](http://bluetoother.github.io/bipso) is an open spec that defines a set of BLE characteristics to follow the IPSO Smart Object Guideline for developers building their applications with a unified data model.

# Boards

A number of boards are interesting to get started with Bluetooth and JavaScript.

## ESP32

ESP32 is a low cost microcontroller with wireless building blocks for Bluetooth and Wifi. Here are some links to get started:

* [ESP32 datasheets](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/IoT/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf)
* [Arduino ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)
* [ESP-WROOM](https://github.com/watterott/ESP-WROOM-Breakout) from watterott

## PunchThrough LightBean

The PunchThrough boards support calling sketches from the command line with a Node.js tool. 
You can install this tool with:

    $ npm install -g bean-sdk

Then, you can follow the examples from the [guides](https://punchthrough.com/bean/docs/guides/getting-started/cli-loader/)

## BueIOT (Platinchen)

Another nice BLE platine is [BlueIOT](https://www.tindie.com/products/FabLab/blueiot-platinchen/)


# Community, forums and bloggers

* [Fablabeu](https://www.hackster.io/fablabeu/) has some projects such as a [DIY Dashbutton](https://www.hackster.io/fablabeu/build-your-dashbutton-6041bf?team=5807)
