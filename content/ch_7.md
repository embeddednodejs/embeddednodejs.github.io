# Chapter 7: Components for Prototyping

This chapter discusses usage of parts and components in an embedded device. When you connect multiple components, they form a circuit.

## Grove Kit 

If you have a software background, you might lack some solder experience. In this case, Grove kit components and components can help you to start building circuits. 

The idea of the <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Main_Page">Grove kit </a> is explained in the Wiki of Seeedstudio.  First, you need a <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html?cPath=98_16">Base shield</a> such as for Arduino Uno.

To the base shield, you can plug one or multiple Grove kit components:

<ul> 
    <li><a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_System">Grove Kit components</a></li> 
   <li><a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Thumb_Joystick">Thumb Joystick</a></li> 
</ul> 

Note that you find the Grove head for the Arduino Nano here: <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/imrehg/grovehat-for-arduino-nano/">Arduino Nano Grove Headers</a>

## Breakout Boards and Shields 

For Arduino, you will find circuits as breakout boards and shields such as: <a href="https://rheingoldheavy.com/i2c-and-spi-education-shield-functionality-overview/">I2C Education Shield</a>. With this shield, you get a temperature sensor, a real time clock and other components ready made for experimentation.

## Design your own PCB

Instead of buying, you can learn how to build your own break out boards. For this, learning a CAD program such as <a href="https://cadsoft.io/">Eagle</a> or <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/download/">Kicad</a>. you can find ideas for circuits on sites such as <a href="http://www.schematics.com/">schematics.com</a>. 

A nice collection of basic breakout boards can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/stefan-lochbrunner/breadboard-widgets) by Stefan Lochbrunner.

A nice Node.js project to render PCB is [pcb-stackup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pcb-stackup).

Many projects to make sharing of hardware easier are currently built. One such project is [kitnic.it](https://kitnic.it/). This platform was presented by [Kaspar Emanuel](https://twitter.com/kaspar_e) at [FOSDEM 2017](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/kitnic_it/).

## Shops 

There are bunch of websites and shops for sourcing components from the internet.

The main places are places such as [Sparkfun](https://sparkfun.com) or [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com). To search [ebay.com](http://ebay.com) or [alibaba - a sort of chinese ebay - ](https://alibaba.com), the <a href="http://www.mysensors.org/">MySensors components search engine</a> is helpful. Another one is <a href="https://www.controleverything.com/products">ControlEverything</a>.

To build setups with "custom" components, [tindie](tindie.com) can be interesting. For example, you can find the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/imrehg/grovehat-for-arduino-nano/">Grove Hat for Arduino Nano</a> to build a cheap Arduino based experimenters kit.

## Community, forums and blogs

* A good forum to learn about PCB design is the [EEVblog forum](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/eda/?PHPSESSID=063c7a9e5e43800c1319b8bd7b63ab63)

* A nice blog to learn about PCBs is from [Bunny Studios](https://www.bunniestudios.com/)
